# Contributing to Swift Concurrency Agent Skill

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This repository contains an **Agent Skill** following the [Agent Skills open format](https://agentskills.io/home), which means it has specific structural requirements beyond typical documentation.

## 🤖 What Are Agent Skills?

Agent Skills are modular capabilities that extend AI agents' functionality. They package instructions, metadata, and resources in a specific format that agents can discover and use automatically. This isn't just documentation—it's a structured skill that AI coding assistants load on-demand.

**Learn more:**
- [Agent Skills Overview](https://agentskills.io/home) - Understanding the format
- [Anthropic's Agent Skills Documentation](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview) - Official specification and best practices

## 🎯 Why This Matters

Contributors who aren't familiar with the Agent Skills format may inadvertently:
- Break the YAML frontmatter structure
- Use incorrect markdown formatting that agents can't parse
- Add content that doesn't follow agent-friendly patterns
- Miss important metadata requirements

**That's why we strongly recommend using AI assistance for contributions.**

## ✨ Recommended Contribution Workflow

### Option 1: Use the Skill-Creator Skill (Highly Recommended)

The best way to contribute is to use Claude with the [skill-creator skill](https://github.com/anthropics/skills/tree/main/skills/skill-creator). This ensures your contribution follows the Agent Skills format correctly.

**How to use it:**

1. **Install the skill-creator skill** in your Claude-compatible tool (Claude.ai, Cursor, etc.)
   ```bash
   # If using skills.sh
   npx skills add https://github.com/anthropics/skills/tree/main/skills/skill-creator
   ```

2. **Ask Claude to help with your contribution:**
   ```
   Use the skill-creator skill to help me update the Swift Concurrency Agent Skill.
   I want to [describe your contribution].
   ```

3. **Review the generated changes** to ensure technical accuracy for Swift Concurrency

4. **Submit your PR** with the AI-generated improvements

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Proper YAML frontmatter structure
- ✅ Agent-friendly markdown formatting
- ✅ Correct file organization
- ✅ Follows best practices from Anthropic's guidelines

### Option 2: Use Claude Without the Skill-Creator

If you don't have access to the skill-creator skill, you can still use Claude (or other AI assistants) to help:

1. **Share the Agent Skills documentation** with Claude:
   - [Agent Skills Overview](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview)
   - [Best Practices](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices)

2. **Ask Claude to review your changes** for Agent Skills format compliance

3. **Request that Claude verify:**
   - YAML frontmatter is valid
   - Markdown structure is agent-friendly
   - Content follows progressive disclosure patterns

### Option 3: Manual Contribution

If you prefer to contribute manually, please carefully review:

1. **The Agent Skills specification**: https://agentskills.io/home
2. **Anthropic's best practices**: https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices
3. **Existing file structure** in this repository

**Key requirements:**
- YAML frontmatter must be valid and complete
- Use clear, actionable headings
- Keep instructions concise and agent-friendly
- Follow the existing reference file patterns
- Test your changes with an AI agent if possible

## 🚀 Pull Request Process

1. **Fork the repository** and create a new branch
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-contribution
   ```

2. **Make your changes** (preferably using the skill-creator skill or Claude)

3. **Test your changes:**
   - Verify code examples compile
   - Check markdown formatting
   - Test with an AI agent if possible

4. **Commit with a clear message:**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add guidance for Swift 6.2 isolated deinit"
   ```

5. **Submit a pull request** with:
   - **Clear description** of what you changed and why
   - **Rationale** for the change (link to Swift documentation, real-world scenario, etc.)
   - **Mention if you used skill-creator or Claude** to ensure format compliance
   - **Test results** if applicable

6. **Respond to feedback** - We may request changes to ensure accuracy or format compliance
