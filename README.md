# Swift Agent Skills

A collection of non-opinionated Swift Agent Skills that result in: 

- **Factual code improvements** e.g. replacing deprecated APIs
- **Following industry standard best practices** e.g., Swift 6.2, latest Swift Concurrency features
- **Non-opinionated refactors** e.g. using @Observable instead of ObservableObject. 

The goal of this repo is to provide skills that work with any Swift project, any coding architecture, or coding style.

## Following the Agent Skills Open Format

Following the open format for giving agents new capabilities and expertise as described at [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io/home).

> [!NOTE]
> Agent Skills are folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that agents can discover and use to do things more accurately and efficiently.

Agent Skills are supported by leading AI development tools, including:

## The vision behind this repo
I started using Skills early on and also tried several open-source skills. I found myself struggling with opinionated skills, as they forced my projects in a direction, with an architecture, or with code changes, that I didn't like.

Instead, I want skills that apply industry-standard best practices, code changes that everyone agrees on. That's why **you'll never find skills in this repository that force you to use MVVM or any specific folder structure**.

## Contributing
I'd love to receive contributions; feel free to open a PR for any new skills or improvements to existing skills.
